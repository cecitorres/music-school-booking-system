# Music School Booking System

## Overview

This project is a Booking System for a Music School designed to help private music teachers manage their schedules, bookings, and student interactions. The system allows teachers to set their availability, students to book sessions for specific instruments, and both parties to receive reminders. It is built using .NET and is designed to be simple yet effective.
